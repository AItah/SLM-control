Please install Run-Tme-engine from "Installer\install.exe" to use "Image_controll.dll".

After the installation, the "LabVIEW2018 Run-Time-engine" and the "NI Vision Common Resource 2020" will be available.

These Run-time are needed because the "Image_controll.dll" is made by "LabVIEW2018" and "NI Vision Common Resource 2020".


The "LabVIEW2018 Run-Time-engine" and the "NI Vision Common Resource 2020" are also required in the case of using previous version of LabVIEW sample code.



In the case of using Python-64bit, please install 64bit Run-time-engine from "Installer_for_64bit_SDK\install.exe"
